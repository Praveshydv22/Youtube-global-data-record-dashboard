YouTube Global Data Dashboard in Excel – Simplifying Insights at Scale
Thrilled to share a recent project where I built a comprehensive YouTube Global Data Dashboard using Excel—designed to help teams visualize performance across multiple channels, regions, and content types in one place.
 What it does:
Consolidates YouTube Analytics data from multiple channels
Tracks key KPIs: Views, Watch Time, Subscribers, Revenue (RPM/CPM)
Breaks down performance by geography, content category, and upload type
Interactive filters and dynamic charts for real-time decision-making
Built entirely in Excel—no external BI tools required
